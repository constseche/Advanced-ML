COST SENSITIVE LEARNING: Cost_Sensitive_Learning folder

1.	Class Weighting

3.	Stratification aka Rebalancing
  a.	Under-Sampling 
  b.	Over – Sampling
  c.	Combination of the above 
  
3.	Costing-Rejection Sampling combining with hard voting (Ensemble models)

5.	Minimizing the cost: (this is used only in binary classification problem because some costcla features don’t offer possibilities for multiclass cost-matrix)
  a.	Without calibration
  b.	With sigmoid calibration 
  c.	With isotonic calibration

## 3. Machine Learning Explainability
  ### a. Permutation Importance
  
  What features does a model think are important ? 
  Which features might have a greater impact on the model predictions than the others ? 

  ### b. Partial Dependence Plots 
  
  How does each feature affect your predictions ? 

  ### c. SHAP Values 
  
  Understanding individual predictions.
