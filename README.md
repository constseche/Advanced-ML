COST SENSITIVE LEARNING: Cost_Sensitive_Learning folder

1.	Class Weighting

3.	Stratification aka Rebalancing
  a.	Under-Sampling 
  b.	Over – Sampling
  c.	Combination of the above 
  
3.	Costing-Rejection Sampling combining with hard voting (Ensemble models)

5.	Minimizing the cost: (this is used only in binary classification problem because some costcla       features don’t offer possibilities for multiclass cost-matrix)
  a.	Without calibration
  b.	With sigmoid calibration 
  c.	With isotonic calibration
