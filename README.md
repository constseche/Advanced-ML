## 1. Class Imbalance
  ### a. SMOTE 
  ### b. Tomek Links 
  ### c. NearMiss


## 2. Cost-Sensitive Learning
  ### a. Class Weighting

  ### b. Stratification aka Rebalancing
      a.	Under-Sampling 
      b.	Over – Sampling
      c.	Combination of the above 
  
  ### c. Costing-Rejection Sampling combining with hard voting (Ensemble models)

  ### d. 	Minimizing the cost: (this is used only in binary classification problem because some costcla features don’t offer possibilities for multiclass cost-matrix)
      a.	Without calibration
      b.	With sigmoid calibration 
      c.	With isotonic calibration

## 3. Machine Learning Explainability
  ### a. Permutation Importance
  
  What features does a model think are important ? 
  Which features might have a greater impact on the model predictions than the others ? 

  ### b. Partial Dependence Plots 
  
  How does each feature affect your predictions ? 

  ### c. SHAP Values 
  
  Understanding individual predictions.
